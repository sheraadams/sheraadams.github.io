# About Me

I am a motivated and creative software engineer skilled at combining self-sustained efforts with hard work. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. I have experience working with databases, JavaScript, C++, Python, Lua, Dash, OpenGL, and WebGL to create websites, games, applications, and visualizations that enrich the user experience and promote engagement. I am always thrilled to collaborate!
